6 September 2019 - New mailing lists¶
The Lucene project has added two new announce mailing lists, issues@lucene.apache.org and builds@lucene.apache.org. High-volume automated emails from our bug tracker, JIRA and GitHub will be moved from the dev@ list to issues@ and automated emails from our Jenkins CI build servers will be moved from the dev@ list to builds@.
This is an effort to reduce the sometimes overwhelming email volume on our main development mailing list and thus make it easier for the community to follow important discussions by humans on the dev@lucene.apache.org list.
Everyone who wants to continue receiving these automated emails should sign up for one or both of the two new lists. Sign-up instructions can be found on the Lucene-java and Solr web sites.
26 July 2019 - Apache Lucene 8.2.0 and Apache Solr 8.2.0 Available¶
The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 8.2.0 and Apache Solr 8.2.0
Lucene can be downloaded from https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html and Solr can be downloaded from https://lucene.apache.org/solr/downloads.html
Highlights of this Lucene release include:¶
API Changes:¶
	Intervals queries has been moved from the sandbox to the queries module.
New Features¶
	New XYShape Field and Queries for indexing and querying general cartesian geometries.
	Snowball stemmer/analyzer for the Estonian language.
	Provide a FeatureSortfield to allow sorting search hits by descending value of a feature.
	Add new KoreanNumberFilter that can change Hangul character to number and process decimal point.
	Add doc-value support to range fields.
	Add monitor subproject (previously Luwak monitoring library) that allows a stream of documents to be matched against a set of registered queriesin an efficient manner.
	Add a numeric range query in sandbox that takes advantage of index sorting.Add a numeric range query in sandbox that takes advantage of index sorting.
Optimizations¶
	Use exponential search instead of binary search in IntArrayDocIdSet#advance method.
	Use incoming thread for execution if IndexSearcher has an executor. Now caller threads execute at least one search on an index even if there is an executor provided to minimize thread context switching.
	New storing strategy for BKD tree leaves with low cardinality that can lower storage costs and It can be used at search time to speed up queries.
	Load frequencies lazily only when needed in BlockDocsEnum and BlockImpactsEverythingEnum.
	Phrase queries now leverage impacts.
Highlights of this Solr release include:¶
New features¶
	Add an update param failOnVersionConflicts=false to updates not fail when there is a version conflict
	Add facet2D Streaming Expression.
	Preferred replicas on nodes with same system properties as the query master
	OpenTracing support for Solr
	Raw index data analysis tool (extension of COLSTATUS collection command).
	Add recNum Stream Evaluator.
	Allow zplot to visualize 2D clusters and convex hulls.
	Add a field type for Estonian language to default managed_schema, document about Estonian language analysis in Solr Ref Guide
Bug Fixes¶
	Intermittent 401's for internode requests with basicauth enabled.
	In 8.1, Atomic Updates were broken (NPE) when the schema declared the new nest_path field even if you weren't using nested docs. In-place updates were not affected (worked)
	Fix atomic update encoding issue for UUID, enum, bool, and binary fields.
	Impossible to delete a collection with the same name as an existing alias. This fixes also a bug inREINDEXCOLLECTION when used with removeSource=true which could lead to a data loss.
